<p class="card-text">Because you are a Helper, it will be essential that you have a job that allows you to relate
    closely with other people. You want to connect with others and feel that you have been of service to them. You may
    especially prefer to work with vulnerable people, like children, the sick, or the elderly. </p>

<p class="card-text">Helpers tend to be warm, empathetic people. They are typically friendly and approachable, and put
    others at ease. Helpers are often found listening to other peopleâ€™s stories and trying to coach them through their
    problems. They are often selfless and may put their own needs aside in the service of others.</p>

<p class="card-text">Helpers like their work best when it connects deeply with their values and makes them feel that
    they are making a difference in the world. As a Helper, your primary goal will be to understand what is important to
    you, and decide how you can best manifest your ideals in your chosen career path. </p>
