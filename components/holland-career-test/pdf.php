    especially prefer to work with vulnerable people, like children, the sick, or the elderly.',

<h4 class="card-title mt-4">Choosing the Right Career</h4>
<p class="card-text">As you continue in your career search, it will be crucial that you have a system
    for evaluating your opportunities.
    You need a well-defined approach to looking at various careers and deciding whether they are worth
    further
    exploration. You’ve already taken the first step by assessing your interests, but now the task is to
    take that selfknowledge and translate it into a game plan for exploring your career options.</p>

<p class="card-text">The first step is to clearly understand your criteria for the career path you seek.
    You don’t need to know exactly
    which career is right for you, but you do need to know what you are looking for. You must understand
    the factors
    which are more important to your happiness and satisfaction in a career. Equally, you must
    understand the
    aspects of a career that you want to avoid, so that you don’t end up in a job that frequently
    requires you to do
    things that are not a good fit.</p>

<p class="card-text">This section will suggest some criteria that you may want to use as part of your
    career exploration process. These
    are based on your interest profile, but you will probably find that some of the suggested criteria
    seem more
    relevant to you than others. You may also find that you want to add to what is given here. Use these
    suggestions
    as a starting point to build your own system of evaluating possible careers.
</p>
<h5 class="card-title mt-4">What Makes Your Ideal Career?</h5>
<p class="card-text">In choosing a career, you want to be mindful of the factors that are most important
    to you. Many of these factors will be based on your interests and personality, but some will be
    unique to you. This section will provide you with some guidance in the factors that may be important
    to you in your career search. </p>


<h5 class="card-title mt-4">Satisfying Your Core Needs</h5>
<p class="card-text">An ideal career should satisfy your most fundamental motivations to work. Although
    everyone wants to feel a sense of purpose, we all differ in how we like to feel that we contribute.
    To understand what sort of career will be satisfying, you must understand the factors that create
    satisfaction for you.</p>

<p class="card-text">Below, you will see a list of the factors that are most likely to be important to
    you in a career. Generally, if a career has all or most of these factors, you will find the
    day-to-day work satisfying. As you explore different careers, you can use this list as a sort of
    checklist for each potential career. The more closely a career seems to fit your list of core needs,
    the more likely you will be happy with it in the long term.</p>

<h5 class="card-title mt-4">Doing tasks and activities that suit you</h5>
<p class="card-text">One of the most important aspects of job satisfaction is the extent to
            which your
            daily work fits with your preferred
            types of activities. Although this may seem obvious, it can be easy to overlook the mundane
            day-to-day aspects of
            a job that sounds exciting in the abstract. Before you decide a job is right for you, be
            sure you
            understand what the
            everyday tasks of that job entail, and compare these tasks with your preferred tasks listed
            below.

<!--Tasks to avoid-->
<h5 class="card-title mt-4">Avoiding What You Do not Like</h5>
<p class="card-text">Almost as important as understanding what tasks you enjoy is
                    understanding which tasks and activites you would prefer to avoid. If some parts of
                    a job are very appealing to you, but other aspects are boring, irritating, or
                    otherwise unpleasant, it is unlikely you will be happy in that job over the long term.
</p>
<p class="card-text">For each career you are considering, take stock of the typical daily
                    activities and make sure that you will not have to spend significant time on tasks
                    you do not enjoy. Although nobody has a job that they love all the time, it is
                    important to avoid career paths that require a lot of time spent on activities that
                    you simply are not suited to.</p>

<!--Asking questions-->
<h5 class="card-title mt-4">Asking The Important Questions</h5>
<p class="card-text">As you explore careers, you will be asking many questions.
                            You are probably already wondering about common concerns, like how much
                            money you might make, how much education or training you will need, or how
                            easy it might be to find a job in a particular field.</p>

<p class="card-text">But it’s also important that you ask questions that are
                            personal to you and your interests. These questions will help you dial in to
                            the careers that will suit your personality. Here, we suggest some questions
                            that you may want to ask about each career you are seriously considering.
</p>
<p class="card-text">You might answer these questions by doing research online,
                            in books, magazines, or trade journals, or by interviewing people in the
                            field. You may find that the answers to some questions are not a clear “yes”
                            or “no,” and that’s fine. The goal is not to get black-and-white answers to
                            every question, but to gain a better and more complete understanding of
                            whether a career is a good fit for you.</p>
