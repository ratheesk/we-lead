                    <p>Builders tend to be pragmatic, down-to-earth people who take a “just do it” approach to life.
                        Builders often dislike having to explain or discuss their work with others, preferring instead
                        to jump in and simply get it done.</p>
                    <p>Builders like their work best when they can see a real, physical result of their efforts. As a
                        Builder, your primary career goal will be to discover a job where you can use your physical or
                        mechanical skills to take useful, observable action on the world around you.</p>

                    <p>Because you are a Persuader, you will often gravitate to roles that allow you to sell other
                        people on products, projects, or initiatives. You will find a natural home in the business
                        world, but will enjoy any role where you can set a course of action and use your ingenuity and
                        influence to achieve your goals. You may feel drawn to entrepreneurship and enjoy the risk
                        inherent in starting a new venture.</p>
                    <p>Persuaders tend to be natural salespeople with a high energy level and enthusiasm for engaging
                        with others. They are typically good at developing rapport with others, although they may
                        overwhelm some with their aggressive drive. They are typically competitive, goal-oriented, and
                        ambitious.</p>
                    <p>Persuaders like their work best when they can chase exciting goals, promote new ideas, and close
                        important deals. As a Persuader, your primary career goal will be to find a job where you can
                        take the lead to start and carry out initiatives, act quickly and decisively to set a course,
                        and use your charisma to influence others.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Because you are a Creator, you will seek a career that allows you a great deal of freedom to
                        express yourself. You want to imagine, envision, experiment, and create. You want to develop
                        your own unique point of view and see it manifest in your chosen field.</p>
                    <p>Creators tend to be idealistic, artistic people who are drawn to cultural experiences. They often
                        have many artistic interests and seek out novel forms of expression, from modern art museums to
                        experimental dance. They tend to be unconventional and interested in the offbeat and unusual.
                    </p>
                    <p>Creators like their work best when they can be free of rules and regulations, and follow their
                        inspiration to create something original. As a Creator, your primary career goal will be to
                        decide on the best outlet for your artistic talent and creative expression, and then to create a
                        plan for channeling your inspiration into a profitable career.</p>

                    <h2>Careers to Explore</h2>
                    <p>In this section, we'll show you the top careers that match your interest profile. There are a few
                        things to keep in mind as you read over these career suggestions:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. These career titles are just a starting point.</strong> The careers listed here are
                        among the most commonly found in the labor market and are careers that many people will
                        recognize, like lawyer or physician. However, many people have jobs that don't exactly fit any
                        of the descriptions listed here. You might end up with a job that combines several of these
                        typical roles. You might have a job that's specific to one company or industry. Or you might
                        invent a new career altogether! In short, do not limit your imagination to the jobs listed here.
                        These are a representative sample of jobs that fit your personality, but they do not cover every
                        possibility or opportunity that you will come across in your career path.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Your individuality is key.&nbsp;</strong>The careers in this section are listed
                        generally by how well they fit your interest profile. However, you should not assume that the
                        first career on the list is the best career for you, that the second career listed is the
                        second-best, and so on. You may find careers that spark your interest&nbsp;anywhere on this
                        list. You may also see several careers that do not interest you at all. This is normal and does
                        not mean that your results are not accurate! Everyone is unique, and even someone with an
                        identical interest profile to yours will have different inclinations, passions, and preferences.
                        So while this assessment can point you in the right general direction and give you some good
                        ideas to get started, the ultimate choice of your best career will be up to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Ultimately, the choice is yours.</strong> Because no assessment can tell you exactly
                        which career will be perfect for you, the best way to think of this list is as a starting point
                        for your career research. You can use this list to get ideas of careers that may suit you, but
                        you'll still need to read more about each career that interests you, do real-world research
                        (like interviewing or shadowing people in the field), and evaluate each career according to your
                        own personal criteria. We'll discuss this in more detail later in your report, but for now, just
                        read over this list with an open mind. See if any career ideas stand out as particularly
                        interesting, and which seem worthy of further inspection.</p>
                    <p>With that in mind, let's look at some careers!</p>
                    <h3>Your Top Career Matches</h3>

                    <h2>Choosing the Right Career</h2>
                    <p>Now that you’ve reviewed some possible careers, you may be wondering where to go next. Perhaps
                        your list of suggested careers seems overwhelming and confusing. Perhaps you saw some career
                        ideas that sounded interesting, but you’re not sure how to proceed, or how to decide which is
                        really best for you. This section is designed to give you a roadmap that you can use to navigate
                        forward as you explore your career possibilities.</p>
                    <p>As you continue in your career search, it will be crucial that you have a system for evaluating
                        your opportunities. You need a well-defined approach to looking at various careers and deciding
                        whether they are worth further exploration. You’ve already taken the first step by assessing
                        your interests, but now the task is to take that self-knowledge and translate it into a game
                        plan for exploring your career options.</p>
                    <p>The first step is to clearly understand your criteria for the career path you seek. You don’t
                        need to know exactly which career is right for you, but you do need to know what you are looking
                        for. You must understand the factors which are more important to your happiness and satisfaction
                        in a career. Equally, you must understand the aspects of a career that you want to avoid, so
                        that you don’t end up in a job that frequently requires you to do things that are not a good
                        fit.</p>
                    <p>This section will suggest some criteria that you may want to use as part of your career
                        exploration process. These are based on your interest profile, but you will probably find that
                        some of the suggested criteria seem more relevant to you than others. You may also find that you
                        want to add to what is given here. Use these suggestions as a starting point to build your own

                    <p>In choosing a career, you want to be mindful of the factors that are most important to you. Many
                        of these factors will be based on your interests and personality, but some will be unique to
                        you. This section will provide you with some guidance in the factors that may be important to
                        you in your career search.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h4>Satisfying your core needs</h4>
                    <p>An ideal career should satisfy your most fundamental motivations to work. Although everyone wants
                        to feel a sense of purpose, we all differ in how we like to feel that we contribute. To
                        understand what sort of career will be satisfying, you must understand the factors that create
                        satisfaction for you.</p>
                    <p>Below, you will see a list of the factors that are most likely to be important to you in a
                        career. Generally, if a career has all or most of these factors, you will find the day-to-day
                        work satisfying.&nbsp;As you explore different careers, you can use this list&nbsp;as a sort of
                        checklist for each potential career. The more closely a career seems to fit your list of core
                        needs, the more likely you'll be happy with it in the long term.</p>

                        you will not have to spend significant time on tasks you don't enjoy. Although nobody has a job
                        that they love all the time, it is important to avoid career paths that require a lot of time

                    <p>You might answer these questions by doing research online, in books, magazines, or trade
                        journals, or by interviewing people in the field. You may find that the answers to some
                        questions are not a clear “yes” or “no,” and that’s fine. The goal is not to get black-and-white
                        answers to every question, but to gain a better and more complete understanding of whether a
                        career is a good fit for you.</p>
